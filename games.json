And if that's not enough, there are still the ever-increasing enemies and environmental hazards like lightning and water. Or try the game's second mode, Balloon Trip, if you feel like taking a break from the action and just want to see how long you can stay aloft. And, hey, who doesn’t like popping balloons sometimes?",

During game play, the screen shows two different viewpoints: one from behind home plate as you’re batting, and the other from the pitching mound in a television-style shot (unique for the time) as your team plays in the field. Strong play control and excellent graphics add to the excitement as you decide what pitch to throw (you can even try to provoke the opposing batter into charging the mound!), control all of the positions in the field, or do your best to get a hit. So step to the plate and find out why this is one of the most popular baseball games on the NES. Can you pull through in the clutch?",

Blaster Master Zero is an action-exploration game done in an 8-bit top-down & side-view style that hearkens back to the golden age of the NES. Using the original 1988 NES title \"Blaster Master\" from Sunsoft as a base, Blaster Master Zero has many new additions, such as new areas and bosses, new gameplay elements such as extra sub-weapons, improved gameplay, a more robust scenario, refined and expanded exploration mechanics, and more. In the near future on Earth, a young man named Jason Frudnick boards the battle vehicle SOPHIA III and sets off on an adventure in the subterranean depths of the planet. On the side-view maps, take control of SOPHIA III and explore your surroundings as you search for the entrance to the dungeon where the area's boss lurks. Once you find the dungeon entrance, exit SOPHIA III and make your way inside as Jason and take on the mutants inside in top-down mode. Defeat the mid-bosses and area bosses to acquire new items, sub-weapons, upgrades to SOPHIA III and Jason's equipment, and new abilities and move to the next area. What awaits Jason at the end of his long adventure...?",

These are the key to breaking an evil curse put upon Simon by the count. This quest won't be easy, though, for you must battle hideous fiends who stalk the land. In addition to the intense action and tight control the Castlevania series is known for, this sequel also introduced several unique game-play elements into the fold. Build experience the longer you play, buy weapons and items from merchants, or talk with villagers to get clues (some of which are false!). Watch as day turns to night and then back again.

Bubbles isn’t defenseless, though, as she has the ability to stun Sea Urchins with sound waves and quickly change direction using posts scattered throughout the stages. Not only that, but the locations of the gold bars in each maze form the outline of another object—so once you know the object, you’re well on your way to finding the gold!

Armed only with a can of bug spray, Stanley must force Donkey Kong higher and higher into the greenhouse rafters until Donkey Kong is off the screen and the next stage is reached. But not surprisingly, Donkey Kong isn't going to move without a fight, so he sends wave after wave of bugs, bees, and other creatures toward Stanley. Not only must Stanley repel the insects in order to save the flowers, but he'll have to keep an eye out for projectiles thrown by Donkey Kong himself. If Stanley is good enough, he'll be able to grab a can of more powerful bug spray and really get Donkey Kong moving. It all adds up to frantic fun that anyone can enjoy!",

Rool and his baddies have hidden bananas in new places across Donkey Kong Island in another attempt to outwit the best-friend duo. And the only response is for Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong to go off on another adventure! With over 30 levels plus tons of hidden secrets, swing, roll, jump, and barrel blast through worlds swarming with returning and original enemies. Creep along a mysterious pirate ship, trudge through fierce snow, swim in an unbelievable aquatic temple, and start some crazy capers in the sky. There will also be some animal friends waiting to help out. Cranky Kong is off his rocker if he thinks Donkey Kong won't step up to the challenge.",

Change from liquid to a block of ice or a steam cloud to solve fun, gravity-defying puzzles and defeat Goop monsters. Some puzzles require the player to rotate their Nintendo 3DS a full 360 degrees, turning the world upside-down, to navigate through tricky tunnels and crazy contraptions. Each state of water provides the player with different play abilities, all themed to match the properties of that state. This is helpful as the ‘chapters’ of the game contain hidden secrets that encourage exploration. Discovering all the well-hidden puzzle pieces unlocks bonus “playrooms” that provide additional gameplay, and a scoring system (weighing speed vs. accomplishment) provides great re-playability.

The Goddesses, having completed their creation, imbued six relics with remarkable powers to give life and energy to the world they had created. By doing this they made a promise to those who inhabited the world that their peace and well-being would last forever. Many eons have since passed since and humankind has flourished under watchful eye of the two Goddesses. An ‘Empire” soon arose out of the ashes of constant warring and created an advanced civilization using machines. In a far-flung section of the Empire, ancient ruins, long since forgotten, have been unearthed.

They chip away at the blocks overhead, then jump up through the resulting hole to the mountain's next level. Once Popo reaches the top level, he enters a fast-moving bonus stage in which he can pick up veggies and, hopefully, reach the summit for a big point payoff. Of course, not everyone's supportive of Popo's pastime. Toppies fill Popo's holes, so players must jump through the gaps quickly. It's easy to slip off some of the icy levels, as Polar Bears, Toppies, and other ferocious fauna don't want players up there. There are 32 challenging peaks to scale. How will you fare?",

Control the \"throttle valve\" to accelerate, and use the notchless brake to stop at the stopping position! There are many curves and uphills because the route winds through the mountain.

    "description": "Two sisters escape their fate as research subjects and fight to survive using aircrafts of war. Karous -The Beast of Re:Eden- is a 3D vertical shoot 'em up game. This game allows players to design their own aircraft by letting them choose which weapons and items they take with them into battle. The player's aircraft can use shields, different shots, bombs, and swords. Each of these will also level up the more they're used and increase in power. Additional weapons and items will unlock as the player progresses, as well. Karous -The Beast of Re:Eden- features over 100 missions to complete along with a number of achievements in addition to boss battles. Unlike other, traditional shooting games, Karous' mission system gives the player the freedom to follow multiple, branching paths which can lead to different endings.",

    "description": "The newest installment of the fan-favorite Mario Kart™ franchise brings Mushroom Kingdom racing fun into glorious 3D. For the first time, drivers explore new competitive kart possibilities, such as soaring through the skies or plunging into the depths of the sea. New courses, strategic new abilities and customizable karts bring the racing excitement to new heights. FEATURES: The Mario Kart franchise continues to evolve. New kart abilities add to the wild fun that the games are known for. On big jumps, a kart deploys a wing to let it glide over the track shortcut. When underwater, a propeller pops out to help the kart cruise across the sea floor. Players can show their own style by customizing their vehicles with accessories that give them a competitive advantage. For instance, giant tires help a kart drive off-road, while smaller tires accelerate quickly on paved courses. People can choose to race as one of their favorite Mushroom Kingdom characters or even as their Mii™ character. New courses take players on wild rides over mountains, on city streets and through a dusty desert. Nintendo fans will recognize new courses on Wuhu Island and in the jungles from Donkey Kong Country™ Returns. The game supports both SpotPass™ and StreetPass™ features. Players can compete in local wireless matches or online over a broadband Internet connection.",

    "description": "Original Release Date: July 1987 The hero of the game, Jack, must make his way through 16 levels of a pyramid in order to defeat the demon Belzebut and rescue the royal Pamera family. Each level is split into two parts: an action zone and a Royal Palace room. Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups, such as money bags, Mighty Coins, and Mighty Drinks, usually hidden in treasure chests. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors, and Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the game's timer.",

    "description": "Rather than make a direct sequel to their bite-sized 2D action game Mighty Gunvolt from 2014, Inti Creates has made the next installment in the Mighty Gunvolt series a brand new full-sized game that features characters from multiple universes with Gunvolt (Azure Striker Gunvolt) and Beck (Mighty No. 9) taking the stage once again, but in a much deeper and more expansive world that differs greatly from the original in many ways. The game systems have been completely revamped and powered up with lots of new additions, including a deep character customization system that lets you mold and shape your character into the ultimate hero that works best for you! But that's not all! The new Burst Combo system rewards you for finishing off enemies and bosses up close and personal. The classic pixel style graphics have also been completely redone to blur the line between 8-bit and 16-bit and take you back to the golden age of 2D action games!",

Each level is littered with gold as coins rain down from overhead pipes, trails of coins are left behind special gold enemies and gold pipes transport Mario into coin-filled caverns. It's up to players to collect as many coins as possible throughout their adventure. FEATURES: The game records all the coins players collect throughout the game, so completing a level is only part of the fun. Every level is filled with golden opportunities, such as gold rings that turn enemies into valuable gold versions and a Gold Flower that gives Mario the ability to turn almost anything in his path into coins. Coin Rush Mode allows players to collect as many coins as possible across three levels and challenge friends to beat their record via StreetPass. New Super Mario Bros. 2 is an all-new side-scrolling adventure game featuring Mario and Luigi. Two players who each own the game will have the option to play the entire game in two-player multiplayer mode using local wireless. The return of Raccoon Mario gives Mario the ability to fly and access hidden areas. Players will have the option to either purchase the game at retail stores or download the entire game through the Nintendo eShop. In-game content available for purchase using stored account funds.",

Ryu is framed for FBI agent Irene Lew's murder, and it's up to him to clear his name. Defeating superior life-forms created out of \"life energy\" called BIO-NOIDs and avoiding enemy ambushes are among the many obstacles which Ryu faces in this unpredictable adventure of mystery, deceit, and destruction. Ryu's techniques have improved from last time—his ability to grab on to horizontal surfaces, his reduced falling speed and altered jumping maneuvers, as well as using power-ups give Ryu that extra advantage against his foes. Help Ryu defeat the forces of evil once more and discover the real culprit behind Irene’s death as one of the most loved trilogies in video-game history comes to a close!",

    "description": "A sticky situation has never been so fun! There's trouble afoot in the town of Decalburg, where the devious Bowser has disrupted the beloved Sticker Fest by causing the Sticker Comet to explode. Now Royal Stickers and pieces of the comet have been flung far and wide, and it's up to Mario and his ally Kersti to set things right by recovering them. This captivating hand-held Adventure will have new and experienced fans of the Paper Mario series captivated as they navigate colorful 3D environments, defeat enemies, collect oodles of stickers and items and use them in a variety of fun ways. FEATURES Stickers are the key to this imaginative adventure. Battles are turn-based like in the original Paper Mario game, but instead of an attack menu, Mario whomps on his enemies using a sticker to attack. Stickers not only serve as Mario's attacks, but also help solve puzzles throughout the Paper Mario universe when placed in the correct spots. Stickers can be found and collected from all corners of the world, and the flashier the sticker, the more powerful it is. Mario can also spend coins to use the Battle Spinner, which lets him use up to 3 stickers in one turn if the icons are lined up just right. The Battle Spinner can turn the tide in a difficult battle, so collecting coins through the game to use it is crucial. Paper Mario: Sticker Star players get stronger by beating bosses, finding items and completing side missions for other characters in the game instead…",

Take off and pilot a biplane through rings along a predetermined flight path, or drift serenely in a hang glider, catching thermal currents to gain altitude. In either case, just be sure to stick the landing. Strap on the rocket belt to blast your way around an obstacle course. If that's not enough, reach maximum velocity as you tackle a skydiving lesson at 3,800 feet. Complete specific objectives within a set time limit to score points and obtain certification in eight different lessons. Your goals will become more challenging, and weather conditions will make controlling your vehicle more difficult as you progress. If you succeed, you will be rewarded with the opportunity to pilot an attack helicopter on a daring rescue mission.",

Don’t worry, you can use weird in-game items like donuts and nose hair trimmers (that’s not a typo) to help you get the lowest price possible. Hit, catch, toss, and more in individually priced baseball-themed challenges Haggle with Rusty Slugger to lower the real-life price of each minigame Use discount tickets and in-game items to lower prices Share your high score achievements via the StreetPass™ feature In-game content available for purchase using stored account funds. *Broadband Internet access.

With the advanced effect module, you have more power to shape sounds with the ADSR envelope, vibrato, portamento, noise shaper, or digital delay. In addition to that, the drawable waveform synth module allows users to draw and modify their own wave and use it as a sample oscillator – with that you can use Rytmik Ultimate as a sonically unique chiptune synthesizer. Rytmik Ultimate comes with a sound library of more than 750 instruments. Once your work is complete, you can save it in WAV format.

Players are tasked with making their way through a series of perplexing rooms, equipped with nothing more than their ability to \"shift\" the playing field. Is a wall blocking you from progressing? Flip that level upside down and turn that wall into a pit! Of course, that's only the beginning of the challenges players will encounter in Shift DX. The road to victory is paved with mysterious items, complex environmental puzzles, and a variety of deadly traps.

    "description": "Super Mario 3D Land reinvents everything fans love about Mario™ gaming with the first platforming environment in true 3D, without the need for special glasses Players will experience an exhilarating new sense of depth, distance and speed while running, jumping and stomping on enemies throughout the levels. Tanooki Mario returns! The fan-favorite Tanooki suit makes its first appearance on the Nintendo 3DS. Use the Tanooki suit’s tail to attack enemies or float gently down from great heights. These abilities help players move through the 3D environments with more confidence. 3D visuals make it easier for players to judge the depths and distances in their environments. Players can more accurately judge the jump to the next platform or how far Mario is from a question block. New and familiar abilities add unique game-play strategies to the adventure. Mario can perform a rolling somersault attack or run fast with a dash move. The Circle Pad gives players complete control to confidently move Mario through fun and challenging environments. New enemies include Goombas with tails, tall stacks of Goombas and a Piranha Plant that spits ink to obscure a player’s view.",

The single-player mode contains 30 stages, so you'll have to devise a multitude of strategies and maneuvers to conquer them all. Not to mention, each stage will issue you a new challenge, such as defeating an enormous tank that makes yours look like a chew toy. You can take on these challenges aboard your own customized tank or use a provided one. Either way, your tank will have a specific crew capacity and stats. As you battle, you'll find power-ups, like camouflage and Stamina Meat, while earning coins that you can spend to get more troopers, tanks, and paint jobs.

    "description": "All Grace and Savannah want is to make it in Tokyo, but what’s with all the scenesters, bomb balls, flower displays, and ninjas getting in their way?! And don’t even get me started on the UFO abductions, or how easy it is for a visit to Tokyo to end with getting sucked into outer space... You’ll need lightning-fast reflexes and an eye for strategy to succeed in this fast-paced puzzle game, where live-action video blends seamlessly with wacky digital graphics. Throw and roll hapless bystanders into lines of people, trying to group three or more who wear the same color together so that they’ll form a clique and disappear. Form cliques and eliminate the lines you’re facing as fast as you can to progress through the game’s many stages. With two different play modes—Story Mode and Challenge Mode—this game’s got you covered whether you’re looking for quick gaming sessions or longer endurance challenges.",

The Evasive type can use up its energy to hover in the air, dodging all enemy fire whilst being able to fire back itself! It's invincible! The enemy tanks also have new equipment of their own. Elusive Warp Tanks, floating mines flying on to the screen, fixed battery guns with unique bullet variations, and Super Boss Tanks are all making their first appearance! In addition, there are machines that can call additional enemy tanks to the battlefield, completely changing the flow of play! Destroying these machines quickly is the key to victory. There are 90 stages in all. (50 Normal Stages + 40 Extra Stages.) New in this game is local multiplayer. Now two players can go through the excitement of clearing stages together!

In Woah Dave!, players gun for digital glory by slaughtering aliens, stealing their loose change, and racking up the highest score possible.

The brave players who manage to survive the alien onslaught and collect the most coins will be rewarded with top placement on the leaderboards. Do you have what it takes to be the best Dave? Or will you end up playing second fiddle to another, more powerful Dave? If that isn’t enough Dave for you, there’s also Bonkers Mode with more aliens, more lava, and more chances to get killed.

With a hammer as their only tool, players take control of the brothers and set out to destroy ladders, rip out pipes, knock out walls, and detonate explosive devices. But make sure to plan your path of destruction carefully, as each building is designed as its own clever puzzle—if you’re not careful, you can easily trap yourself in a dead end! Adding to the excitement and challenge are fireballs, enemies, and an angry foreman roaming the buildings, all trying to stop you from moving on to the next stage. With 100 buildings to demolish and the ability to construct your own, it’s a wonder Mario and Luigi ever got back to saving the Mushroom Kingdom!",

    "description": "Last year, we launched Dillon’s Rolling Western for the Nintendo 3DS eShop. Dillon is headed back to the eShop in a sequel called Dillon’s Rolling Western: The Last Ranger. This is an action tower-defense game which combines the strategy elements of Dillon defeating enemies with weapon emplacements that players can deploy around the map, and the action elements of Dillon directly attacking opponents with flashy action moves like rolling attacks and claw slashes. New to “The Last Ranger,” Dillon can recruit new allies by battling and defeating them throughout the game. There’s the strong but greedy lizard gunman Gallo, the foolish but powerful bear Boone and the mysterious squid assassin from the East Sea, Nomad. In addition to keeping villages safe from harm from the waves of approaching enemies, Dillon must now also protect a train that moves throughout each of the game’s main stages. Players now have more strategic options to consider, but can share tips on how to clear stages with others via StreetPass. Dillon’s Rolling Western: The Last Ranger will be available in the Nintendo eShop on April 11.",

The action/turn based combat means that battling monsters is not just about using the right skills, but becomes an elegant Pas de Quatre of strategic positioning. Players form their parties with familiar Etrian Odyssey classes, customize individuals using Etrian-style skill trees, and then take up to four members into the dungeons.

As you explore the desert and solve puzzling dungeons, you'll gather resources to build up your oasis with the water spirit Esna. Allies will join your cause, so equip them with weapons, and use their skills to slay towering bosses. The Ever Oasis™ game is a new action-adventure RPG grown from the ground up by Koichi Ishii, creator of the Mana series and producer at GREZZO, the studio that rebuilt multiple The Legend of Zelda™ games for the Nintendo 3DS™ family of systems. Their team has crafted puzzles and traps too perilous for one hero to solve. So recruit a party of allies and level up their stats to learn new battle skills. Then return to your oasis and restore it: choose which shops to build, stock their inventories, collect a share of the profits, and keep villagers happy by fulfilling requests. Before long your oasis will blossom into a beacon of hope for all walks of life in the desert. Don't let them down.",

Get ready to embark on a monstrous adventure created by masters of the craft and brimming with everything that makes 3D platformers and Action-RPGs so great. Gurumin 3D features Parin, a sassy, strong-willed and (surprisingly) heroic young girl who finds herself unexpectedly tossed into a battle between friendly Monsters and evil Phantoms. Learning of the fabled and mysterious Legendary Drill, a powerful weapon that she alone can wield, Parin sets out on an epic quest to save the world from the Phantoms, who are determined to destroy Monster Village and spread darkness across the land. Parin must explore, run, swim, climb, leap, and drill through ruins, caves, snow-capped mountains, lush forests, and more to save her Monster pals and put a stop to the Phantoms' nefarious plans. Uncover rare parts to upgrade the Legendary Drill, imbue it with elemental powers, or use the drill in rare earth to restore lost power. Head back into town to buy, sell, and trade equipment, medals, junk taken from monsters and other objects. Equip Parin with upgradable outfits and headgear for new strengths and abilities, and learn how to perform dozens of unlockable attacks and special moves. Gurumin 3D features tons of traps, puzzles, treasures and mini-games together with real-time rhythm-based combat, 35+ hours of playtime, 90+ items, unlockable difficulty levels, multiple endings, and fully upgradable weapons and gear. Voicing is by an all-star cast including Tara Strong from My…",

    "description": "Battles take place on an isometric grid, requiring you to move characters and take advantage of terrain in order to be successful. Story Long ago there were two continents, split into north and south by a large ocean. These two continents under went vastly different development. In the north continent, the Flare Kingdom, with their advanced industry and powerful military background, expanded their sphere of influence. They annexed neighboring states until the entire north continent was under their control. On the other hand, the tribes of the Kirialos country in the southern continent were at constant war over their plentiful resources. Having achieved domination of their own continent, the Flare Kingdom set their sights on Kirialos's resources. The Flare Kingdom intervened in the wars on the south continent in the name of peacekeeping, but took complete control in the blink of an eye. The Flare Kingdom set up a puppet government in Kirialos, whilst syphoning the wealth obtained from its resources back to their own continent. That's when the \"Liberation Army\" appeared - it's sights set on overthrowing the Kingdom and its puppet government. To deal with this uprising, the Kingdom set up a local ministry of war. The name of the Kingdom's foreign campaign regiment was \"Coronea\"― The mercenaries who joined this unit, be it for money, fame or honor, became known as the \"Kingdom's Dogs\". This is where their story begins.",

Her country has been ravaged by shadowy creatures who corrupt the soil, preventing crops from growing -- and since this same phenomenon has been occurring in PopoloCrois as well, the king now seeks her counsel. Her expert opinion? Prince Pietro should visit Galariland personally as an ambassador for PopoloCrois, to see the damage first-hand and learn all the ways the Galari people are fighting back. But once he's there, he finds there's no way home, and his princely name holds little sway over the long-suffering people of this new world. It is up to you, as Prince Pietro, to make a life for yourself in Galariland while seeking a way home, doing everything you can in the meantime to cultivate the earth and new friendships alike.

The rich 3D visuals provide a remarkable sense of depth, distance and position as players dodge meteors and blast enemy fighters out of the sky. A complete graphical update brings a Nintendo classic into the era of portable 3D fun. The game makes effective use of the Nintendo 3DS system’s dual screens: The top screen features 3D aerial combat, while the bottom screen displays characters and dialogue. There are two control methods for the player to experience. The Nintendo 64 Mode offers original controls, while the new Nintendo 3DS Mode uses the motion controls of the built-in Gyro Sensor of the Nintendo 3DS system. Trusted wingmen Peppy, Slippy and Falco are along for the ride – if one of them is chased or captured by an enemy, players must act to protect them in order to keep their team strong. Each mission takes players through a different planet of the Lylat system as they blast enemies, collect power-ups and fight powerful bosses on their way to the final battle. A new multiplayer option lets up to four players engage in fierce aerial combat via a local wireless connection (using four systems and one game card via DS Download Play). The multiplayer mode also includes new power-ups and special weapons. Players can use the Nintendo 3DS system’s…",

    "description": "After selling millions and being a cultural phenomenon in Japan, YO-KAI WATCH is coming to the United States for the Nintendo 3DS family of systems. The YO-KAI WATCH game is about hundreds of sometimes cute, sometimes spooky, and usually mischievous Yo-kai that inhabit our world. Yo-kai are not ghosts, monsters or creatures. Yo-kai are, quite simply, Yo-kai. They cannot be seen by the human eye, but they are everywhere. Whether born from the soul of a deceased human, or an everyday object discovering its higher purpose, their personalities are distinctly humanlike. As you explore the world, use your Yo-kai Watch to find them, befriend them, and turn them into a team to battle other Yo-kai. Befriending new Yo-kai may not be so easy, though – in many cases, you will need to battle with them and impress them during your battle. Each Yo-kai has its own unique skills and strengths and you’ll use them to challenge the evil Yo-kai and help people in need of solving daily problems – like an argument with a friend or forgetting something important – which may be caused by mischievous Yo-kai hidden everywhere. Features: With the power of the Yo-kai watch, find and befriend more than 200 hidden Yo-kai, found everywhere in the world, and call upon their powers when you need their help. Assemble a team of six Yo-kai in your watch to defeat evil and help people. Each Yo-kai has its own unique skills and strengths, so use strategy to assemble your team to address different problems and…",

    "description": "Chase: Cold Case Investigations ~Distant Memories~ is an adventure mystery game from the mind of Taisuke Kanasaki, director of the famed Hotel Dusk: Room 215! Join the exploits of two gritty detectives whose sense of justice and raw instinct drive them to seek the truth. Put your sleuthing skills to the challenge by re-investigating old crime scenes and solving cold cases by searching for clues and interrogating perps! Find leads by diving head first into old investigation notes, crime scene photos and eye witness reports as you put together all the pieces. Once you have a solid lead, interrogate persons of interest to see what they do (or don't) know. Grill perps by asking tough questions, but be careful! Ask the wrong questions and your Interrogation Gauge will deplete. Ask too many wrong questions and it's Game Over!",

We, as the Pharaoh, can use different traps to defeat those damn ambitious humans who are profaning your tomb. Retro style: Like many of our games, Defend Your Crypt will have retro pixel art. In addition, we will lean toward Egyptian style. Trap variety: The game will contain classic traps such as open platforms, which can make robbers fall onto spikes, and also water traps or killer scorpions and beetles. Gore: In Ratalaika Games, we know you like blood, so we have included it. A lot of it. Killing the robbers won’t be enough. \"If it bleeds, we can kill it\", and we’re taking it to the limit. (If you don’t like blood, you can deactivate it :P) Levels: A large number of levels to make sure the robbers will not steal any of your gold, and you enjoy the game to the fullest. A lot of time can be spent on finishing all of them!",

Places you go are mapped automatically, and once you cover all the tiles on a floor you will complete the picture hidden underneath. As in the previous game, battles feature a large number of dynamic and powerful enemies. The hero is unable to attack due to the Witch's Curse, so he must protect his partner with a shield and guide her to attack by chopping down or slashing sideways. Also, you can trigger a power move by raising the shield at the same time as an enemy attack. Explore the depths of the dungeon to uncover the mystery of the Witch's Curse!",

    "description": "Leave button mashing behind. Sakura Samurai: Art of the Sword is about precision swordplay, battlefield finesse, and martial-arts style. As the heroic title character, you’ll travel a world rife with cherry-blossom beauty—and deadly danger—to rescue the legendary Princess Cherry Blossom. Her kidnapper has set dozens of blade-wielding henchmen in your path, and you’ll have to exercise your best battle senses to defeat them and save her. Learn to predict your foes’ moves, deftly dodge their attacks, and create opportunities for devastating counterattacks. Start with the Sakura Sword, a little health, and some basic training from your water-spirit guide. Make your way from battleground to battleground fighting wave after wave of increasingly cunning enemies. Fight through huge castles to duel epic bosses. And don’t forget to stop at small villages along the way to get help, gear, encouragement (and distraction) from the quirky townsfolk. Prove that you truly are the Sakura Samurai!",

    "description": "Considered one of the best RPGs of 2009*, the original Devil Survivor presented gamers with a novel premise: Tokyo is in full lockdown, the government's swift, coldblooded response to a surprise demon invasion. While you and your friends must solve the nature of the interdimensional rift through which the horrific creatures are entering your world, saving the world is not your highest priority; staying alive, on the other hand, is. Expanded and enhanced, Devil Survivor Overclocked for Nintendo 3DS builds upon the game's original release with the addition of voice acting for the entirety of the game's lengthy, unconventional narrative. Moreover, that very story, already boasting multiple endings based on critical decisions by the player, now concludes with a special eighth chapter, a rousing epilogue for Shin Megami Tensei fans. The game's beautifully remastered hand drawn artwork and character portraits benefit from the new system's higher resolution screens, offering players a crisper, higher fidelity experience.",

To help her cope with this move, her friend Ayumi has devised a seemingly innocent plan: the whole group will come together to perform a charm she found on the internet called \"Sachiko Ever After\", which is supposed to bind all of its participants together as friends to the end. This does not go as expected. Following an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary School, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago. Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of survival - much less escape - is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them.",

She has no money, no papers and no idea how she got into this situation. But she'll be damned if she doesn't find out what this crap is all about - to put it in her words. Stranded in Miami, she now goes to see her mother, whom she hasn't seen in years. And her mother has no inkling of Mia's real job… You will meet a wide variety of people over the course of this gripping tale. Some will be on your side, others not so much.

    "description": "Never before released in North America, this long-awaited entry in the acclaimed Devil Summoner series takes players into a future in which technology and otherworldly forces meet in a macabre fusion of cyberpunk futurism and gothic horror. A first-person sci-fi RPG epic, Soul Hackers tells of a city held up as a beacon of humanity's triumph of technology, but with an infernal secret. In this would-be utopia, a group of hackers takes on a centuries-old mystic society, and a battle for control over humanity's fate is about to begin... In a society originated from a bizarre marriage of technology and demonology, an unleashed evil—borne of an inconvenient truth—threatens to bring an end not just to the deceptive harmony, but to mankind itself. Improved graphics marry with extensive voice acting, a host of technical enhancements, and 3D dungeon exploration to make Soul Hackers a natural fit to the Nintendo 3DS. The portable COMP units allow players to tap into the tech-heavy world and can be upgraded to offer new features and abilities.

    "description": "A spatial distortion full of demons appeared in Antarctica, threatening to engulf the Earth in Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey. The United Nations responded by tasking a team of highly advanced specialists with piercing the anomaly and figuring out how to stop it from the source. Well, get ready to don your Demonica once again in this new expanded port: Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux. Expect new story content, additional endings, a new dungeon to explore, and more in the return of this sci-fi tinged SMT adventure. In Strange Journey Redux, you play as a brave United Nations soldier investigating a spatial anomaly called the Schwarzwelt—a dome of dark energy that threatens to consume the world. Inside, you'll find it home to a nightmare mirror of our own Earth, populated with demons dying to meet you. The game touts brand-new illustrations by Masayuki Doi, updated visuals, UI tweaks, and more to make this journey back into the Schwarzwelt… even stranger. You won't be retreading the same nightmarish path as before because a brand-new character named Alex will play a major role in how the story unfolds. Much about her is a mystery, but there is one thing you know for sure: she's got a bone to pick with you. Joining her are new demons you might recognize from other SMT entries, new endings, and a new dungeon to discover. With its twisted demonic sci-fi story, addictive demon-collecting fun, and multiple narrative paths to explore, Strange Journey Redux is an essential ATLUS JRPG adventure that can't…",

When three mysterious objects fall from the sky, this secluded, sleepy town becomes frozen in a moment in time. Strange radiation has turned local wildlife bloodthirsty. Only 3 people in Silver Falls seem to be unaffected. Holt, a composer mourning the death of his grandfather with a fishing trip, Analise, an organizer for the annual Moose Steak Festival, and Moss, the local sheriff investigating reports of strange lights in the sky, must work together to figure out exactly what is going wrong in their town.
